- Backend service: `backend/licensemanagement` (Lumen 7) – see `AGENTS.md` for build/test steps.
- Frontend client: `frontend` (Vue 2) – follow `AGENTS.md` plus `doc/Design` for architecture diagrams (`LicenseManagement.7z`).
- Additional contributor guidance, including infrastructure references, lives entirely in `AGENTS.md`.
- Local database setup instructions: `doc/DevelopmentDatabase.md` (creates `license_local` schema and user for MySQL).
